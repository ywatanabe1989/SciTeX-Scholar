"""Parity tests for the Django port of the Scholar GUI.

Ports the intent of the Flask-era behaviour (no dedicated Flask test file
existed under tests/scitex_scholar/gui/ beyond a smoke-import mirror, so
this is new coverage written directly against the ported views):

  GET /               -> 200, title + favicon link present
  GET /api/health      -> JSON {"status": "ok", "version", "api_available",
                                "api_url"}
  GET /api/graph/network   -> 400 without ?doi=, 503 with no API configured
  GET /api/graph/related   -> 503 with no API configured
  GET /api/graph/paper     -> 503 with no API configured
  GET /api/graph/health    -> 503 with no API configured

Uses Django's `RequestFactory` directly against the view functions
(bypasses URL routing, same approach as scitex-writer's precedent at
scitex_writer/tests/_django/test_views.py) with a TEST-ONLY settings
bootstrap via conftest.py (bare `django.setup()`, no pytest-django dep).

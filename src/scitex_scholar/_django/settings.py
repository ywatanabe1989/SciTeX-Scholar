"""Minimal standalone Django settings for `scitex-scholar gui`.

Used only by the standalone launcher; cloud deployments ignore this
module and mount `scitex_scholar._django.urls` under their own prefix.

Mirrors the `scitex_writer._django.settings` pattern: bare-minimum
installed apps, optional `scitex_ui` for the shared workspace shell, and
the fleet PostgreSQL so any future models work out of the box.

`SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_API_URL` is resolved ONCE here at settings-load time (mirroring
how the Flask `create_app()` resolved its backend once too) so `views.py`
reads a plain setting instead of re-probing on every request.

# otherwise inherit whatever the default was.

"""Read scitex-scholar environment variables under the fleet-prefixed name.

Every environment variable scitex-scholar OWNS is spelled
``SCITEX_SCHOLAR_<X>``. That convention is not new — the config layer
(``config/_categories/*.yaml``) already interpolates the prefixed names, and
the published skill table in ``_skills/scitex-scholar/20_env-vars.md`` already
documents them.

Several call sites never got the memo and read the bare name directly, which
made the documentation WRONG rather than merely inconsistent: a user who set
the variable scholar's own docs tell them to set got nothing, because the code
was reading a different name. `resolve_env` closes that gap without breaking
anyone who is currently relying on the legacy spelling.

Precedence is canonical-first, and the legacy read is LOUD. A silent fallback
here would be the same defect in a new place: the user would keep believing
the documented name works, and the day the legacy name is removed their setup
breaks with no warning ever having been issued.

    ----------
    canonical
        The ``SCITEX_SCHOLAR_*`` name. Always read first, and always wins
        when both are set — the documented name must be the one that works.
    legacy
        A pre-convention spelling still honoured for back-compat, or several
        of them in precedence order (the first one set wins). Using any of
        them emits a warning naming it and the canonical spelling, once per
        process per legacy name.
    default
        Returned when neither name is set.

    Returns
    -------
    str or None
        The resolved value, or ``default`` when neither variable is set.
